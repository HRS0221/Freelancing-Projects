# Form Trigger Test Cases

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Enhanced Trigger Detection
- Added more comprehensive document triggers including:
  - `certificate`, `certificates`
  - `generate cert`, `create cert`, `need cert`, `want cert`
  - `employment cert`, `experience cert`, `salary cert`
  - `bonafide cert`, `noc cert`, `verification cert`
  - `promotion cert`, `relieving cert`, `offer cert`, `appointment cert`

### 2. Added Fallback Detection
- Added fallback keyword detection for document-related terms
- Ensures forms are displayed even if specific triggers are missed

### 3. Added Manual Access Buttons
- Added "Documents" button in header
- Added "Request Document" and "Summarize PDF" buttons below input
- Provides multiple ways to access forms

### 4. Enhanced Debugging
- Added console logging for trigger detection
- Added debug info display in development mode
- Added form state change monitoring

## Test Commands

### Should Trigger Document Form:
- "i need a document"
- "i want document" 
- "certificate"
- "generate certificate"
- "create certificate"
- "need certificate"
- "employment certificate"
- "experience certificate"
- "salary certificate"
- "bonafide certificate"
- "noc certificate"
- "verification certificate"
- "promotion certificate"
- "relieving certificate"
- "offer certificate"
- "appointment certificate"

### Should Trigger PDF Form:
- "summarize pdf"
- "upload pdf"
- "pdf summarization"
- "summarize document"
- "pdf processing"
- "document summarization"
- "upload document"

### Manual Access:
- Click "Documents" button in header
- Click "Request Document" button below input
- Click "Summarize PDF" button below input

## Debug Information

The component now includes:
- Console logging for trigger detection
- Debug display showing form states
- Form state change monitoring
- Enhanced error handling

## Expected Behavior

1. When a document-related command is typed, the document form should appear inline
2. When a PDF-related command is typed, the PDF uploader should appear inline
3. Manual buttons should always work regardless of trigger detection
4. Console should show debug information for troubleshooting
